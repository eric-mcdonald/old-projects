*** This program requires you to have basic knowledge of C. ***


How to use this program:

1. When you create a new project, Copy all .c from this folder into the project's Source category. Copy all .h files into the Headers category.
2. Allow main_bridge.c to contain the actual main function (rename/remove any other present main functions).
3. Declare your 'main function' in main_impl_defs.h. Implement them in your own files. *+
4. Register your 'main function' pointer in main_bridge.c *+

* There are some TODO comments labeled as "TODO:". You should read and follow these accordingly.
+ You may declare and register multiple 'main functions'.

Example:

In main_impl_defs.h:
int ExampleDeclMain(int argc, char *argv[]);

In your_impl_file.c:
int ExampleDeclMain(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	// Do something.
	return 0;
}

Then, in main_bridge.c's main function (before the call to PromptMain):
RegisterMain(ExampleDeclMain);

The program will prompt you for a 'main function ID'. The ID of your main function is determined by the order of successful calls to RegisterMain. Zero (0) is the first ID. ID's can range from 0 to kMaxRegisteredMains - 1 (defined in main_bridge.h).

Any error codes related to the program will have a base of MAIN_ERROR_BASE (defined in main_bridge.h)
