WORDS
-----
There are many ways to move from one word to another. Consider these:

        w       Move to the beginning of the next WORD
        e       Move to the END of the current word (or end of the next word
                if currently at the end of a word)
        b       Move BACK to the beginning of the current word (or beginning
                of the previous word if currently at the beginning of a word)

For  w, e, and b,  a word is delimited by any non-alphanumeric
character. The capitalized versions,  W, E, and B,  also move from word
to word. The difference is that for  W, E, and B,  a word is delimited
by any blank space.

>>>  Try out  w, b, e,  on the lines provided below.
>>>  Next practice using  B, W, b, E  on the lines provided below.

ON THE LINE
-----------
You can move immediately to any point on the current line.

        $       Move to the end of the line
        ^       Move to the first non-white character on the line
	0       Move to the first column on the line (column zero)

>>>  Experiment with  $  and  ^  on the line provided below.  Notice
>>>  that  ^  moves to the first non-white character, not the beginning.

    This is a PRACTICE LINE.  There is white space at the front.  END

0 (zero) will always take you to the far left edge of the screen.


FINDING CHARACTERS
------------------
Often you want to move to a specific letter or character on a line.

    f char	FIND the next occurrence of char on the line

If the specified character is not on the line, vi will beep.

>>>  Move to the beginning of the line below, and try out these commands:
>>>	fe  fE 

    "PRACTICE line?" "Each and Every?" "Find thE char@cter and move to it.END


WINDOW POSITIONS
----------------
You can move the cursor to the top, middle, or bottom of the vi window.

	H    Move to the HIGHEST position in the window
	M    Move to the MIDDLE position in the window
	L    Move to the LOWEST position in the window

>>>  Try out these commands:  type  H  then  M  and  L  and then  M  again.


GO TO A LINE
------------

         G      GO to the last line in the file
        #G      GO to line #.  (e.g., 3G , 5G , 124G )
        ''	(quote quote) return from last movement

Read these directions carefully:
>>>  Type  1G  to go to the top of the file, and then  ''  (quote quote)
>>>  to return here.
>>>  Now try  G  to go to the end of the file, and then  ''  to return here.


BLOCKS OF TEXT
--------------
It is often convenient to move through files jumping from one block of
text to the next.  To do this use braces and parentheses:

	{	(left brace) Move to the beginning of a paragraph
        }	(right brace) Move to the end of a paragraph

        (	(left paren) Move to the beginning of a sentence
        )	(right paren) Move to the beginning of the next sentence

>>>  Experiment with  }  and  {  on the two paragraphs provided below.
>>>  Note that paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

	EXPERIMENT on this first paragraph.  The quick brown fox jumped
    over the seven lazy dogs.  The fox must have been very large to
    jump over seven dogs!

	EXPERIMENT on this second paragraph.  The quick brown dog
    jumped over the seven lazy foxes.  The dog didn't have to be nearly
    as large, since foxes aren't too big.

>>>  Try out  )  and  (  on the two paragraphs provided above.
>>>  Notice that sentences are separated by two blank spaces.


SEARCHING
---------
This enables you to jump to the next occurrence of a string in a file.
To initially find the string use:

    /string	 Find string looking forward
    ?string	 Find string looking backward

To find additional occurrences of the string type:

	n	 Repeat last / or ? command
	N	 Reverse last / or ? command

vi may search past the bottom of the file and then start again at the top. 
(Or, vi may search past the top and then start again at the bottom.)

>>>  You are going to search for a string, find the next three
>>>  occurrences.  Then flip directions and find the string until you
>>>  return to this location.  To do this:
>>>      Type   /the   then press RETURN.  
>>>	 Type  n  three times.
>>>	 Type  N  until you return to this location.


SUMMARY
-------

        w       Move to the beginning of the next WORD
        e       Move to the END of the next word
        b       Move BACK to the beginning to the previous word

        $       Move to the end of the line
        ^       Move to the first non-white character on the line
	0       Move to the first column on the line (column zero)

    f char	FIND the next occurrence of char on the line

	H	Move to the HIGHEST position in the window
	M	Move to the MIDDLE position in the window
	L	Move to the LOWEST position in the window

         G      GO to the last line in the file
        #G      GO to line #.  (e.g., 3G , 5G , 175G )
        ''	(quote quote) return from last movement

        {	(left brace) Move to the beginning of a paragraph
        }	(right brace) Move to the end of a paragraph

        (	(left paren) Move to the beginning of a sentence
        )	(right paren) Move to the beginning of the next sentence

    /string	 Find string looking forward
    ?string	 Find string looking backward

	n	 Repeat last / or ? command
	N	 Reverse last / or ? command

You should now be able to move around files very efficiently.
Practice the material in this lesson at every opportunity.
