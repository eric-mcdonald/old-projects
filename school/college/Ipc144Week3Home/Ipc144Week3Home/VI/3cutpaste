vi tutorial #3: Copying, Cutting, and Pasting

This lesson lasts 10-15 minutes.  This tutorial assumes full knowledge
of tutorial #1, and familiarity with tutorial #2.  Lines which begin
with  >>>  mark exercises you should try.

When you want to exit this tutorial type  :q!<RETURN>  to exit without
saving changes.  Remember that typing  u  will UNDO your last change.


CUTTING TEXT
------------
The delete command can be combined with any of the movement commands
taught throughout tutorial #2.  The resulting command is of the form:

    dmovement	DELETE to where the movement command specifies

Consider the following examples:

	dw	DELETE to the beginning of the next WORD
	d$	DELETE to the end of the line
	d)	DELETE to the beginning of the next sentence 
	dd	DELETE a line (dd is a special case of the d command)

>>>  Experiment with  dw  d$  d)  dd  on the paragraph provided below:

    PRACTICE here.  Now is the time for all good users to learn the
    editor.  The quick brown fox jumped over the seven lazy fish.  Now
    is the time for all good users to learn the editor.  The quick
    brown computer jumped over the seven lazy users.  END PRACTICE


PASTING TEXT
------------
When text is deleted it is put into a buffer which contains the most
recently deleted text.  To paste the contents of this buffer elsewhere
in the file use the  p  or  P  command.

	P	(upper p) PUT the contents of the buffer before the cursor
	p	(lower p) PUT the contents of the buffer after the cursor

>>>  Try this sequence of commands on the practice lines below:
>>>	dd	to delete the first line
>>>	}	to move to the end of the paragraph
>>>	p	(lower p) to PUT the deleted text after the cursor

	PRACTICE line.  Cut and Paste this line to the bottom of the
	paragraph.  Here is some filler, feel free to cut and paste the
	text in this practice region.  Remember that  u  undoes the last
	action.  END OF PRACTICE

>>>  Try this sequence of commands at the beginning of a word:
>>>	dw  w  P

The fastest way to swap two letters is to type:  xp

>>>  Use  xp  to correct the misspelled words below:

	PRACTICE.  Their weird quiet recieved an inconvenient shriek.
	Thier belief is that to recieve grief from nieghbors outwieghs
	all else.  Biege skies lead to wierd science.  END.


NUMBERING
---------
Consider cutting and pasting 3 words.  Based on previous exercises you
would type  dw , move to the new location, and type  p , and repeat
this procedure twice more.  There is an easier way to do this:

>>>  Using the practice lines below, try the following sequence of commands:
>>>    Move to the beginning of the first sentence.
>>>    Type  d3w  to DELETE 3 WORDS.
>>>    Type  w  to move ahead one WORD. 
>>>    Type  P  (upper p) to PUT the three words before the cursor.

    PRACTICE Numbering vi commands is easy to do.  Now is the time for
    all good users to learn the editor.  The quick brown fox jumped
    over the seven lazy dogs.  Numbering vi commands is easy to do.
    Now is the time for all good users to learn the editor. END PRACTICE

>>>  Type  d2d  to DELETE 2 lines, using the practice paragraph above.
>>>  Move to the top of the paragraph.
>>>  Type  p  (lower p) to PUT the two lines after the cursor.

Numbering also works for movement commands.

>>>  Now try  4w  to move ahead 4 WORDs, on the lines provided above.  
>>>  Then use  3b  to move BACK 3 words.

When you type  4w  THINK "4 words", when you type  d4w  think "delete 4
words".  In general, we can write

    #movement	repeat movement # times
    d#movement	DELETE to where the  #movement  command specifies


COPYING TEXT
------------
The YANK command works just like the DELETE command, except  y  is used
instead of  d  .

    ymovement	YANK to where the movement command specifies

YANK and DELETE are identical except that YANK only copies the specified
text into the buffer.

>>>  Try this sequence of commands on the practice lines below:
>>>  	yy  	to YANK a line (yy is a special case of the y command)
>>>	3j	to move down 3 lines
>>>	p	(lower p) to PUT the yanked text after the cursor

	PRACTICE line.  Copy and Paste this line to the bottom of the
	paragraph.  Here is some filler, feel free to copy and paste the
	text in this practice region.  Remember that  u  undoes the last
	action.  END OF PRACTICE

Please note that copy, cutting, and pasting large blocks of text may
significantly alter the tutorial file.  Remember that you can always get
a new copy of the tutorial file and that  u  UNDOes your last change.

Here are some examples which show the similarity between  y  and  d .

	yw	YANK to the beginning of the next WORD
	y$	YANK to the end of the line
	y)	YANK to the beginning of the next sentence 
	yy	YANK a line 

Here are some more examples using commands from tutorial #2.

	yL	YANK from here to the lowest point of the window
	y/and	YANK from here to the word "and"
	y2}	YANK 2 paragraphs

>>>  Experiment with  yw  y4w  y2}  y3y  and  y$  on the paragraph
>>>  provided below.  Copy text AND use  p  or  P  to paste it.

	PRACTICE line.  Copy and Paste this line to the bottom of the
	paragraph.  Here is some filler, feel free to copy and paste
	the text in this practice region.  Remember that  u  undoes the
        last action.  END OF PRACTICE


SAVING WITHOUT QUITTING
-----------------------
With  ZZ  you save changes and quit vi.  With :w  you can save and not
quit vi.  It is a safe practice to save changes to a file regularly.
This reduces re-typing in the event your computer crashes.

    :w<RETURN>	WRITE contents of the file (without quitting)
		(type a colon, type w , then press the RETURN key)


SUMMARY
-------

    #movement	repeat movement # times

    dmovement	DELETE to where "movement" command specifies
    d#movement	DELETE to where the  #movement  command specifies
		(e.g.  dw  d3w )

    ymovement	YANK to where "movement" command specifies
    y#movement	YANK to where the  #movement  command specifies
		(e.g.  yw  y3w )

	P	(upper p) PUT the contents of the buffer before the cursor
	p	(lower p) PUT the contents of the buffer after the cursor

    :w<RETURN>	WRITE contents of the file (without quitting)
		(type a colon, type w , then press the RETURN key)


You are now prepared to handle most cutting, copying and pasting tasks
which may arise.  If you practice what you've learned you'll find editing
in vi to be fast and convenient.

If you wish to exit this tutorial now, you may type  :q!
