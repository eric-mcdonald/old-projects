vi tutorial #5: Tricks and Timesavers

This lesson lasts 5-10 minutes.  You should have a strong
understanding of tutorials #1-3 before working through these timesaving
techniques.  Lines which begin with  >>>  mark exercises you should
try.  When you want to exit this tutorial type  :q!


REPEAT LAST COMMAND
-------------------
Often you want to make the same change at multiple locations in the
file.  To help accomplish this, vi remembers your previous action.

	.	(dot) repeat last change

>>> Go through the example below changing "FISH" to "TOAD":
>>>	Go to the "F" in the first instance of "FISH"
>>>	To change the word:  type  cw  then type  TOAD  then press ESC
>>>     Move the cursor to "F" in the second occurence of "FISH"
>>>     Type  .  (dot)
>>>     Move the cursor to "F" in the final occurence of "FISH"
>>>     Type  .  (dot)
>>>     Now move the cursor to each occurence of "CROW";  Type  .  (dot)

	EXAMPLE:  The FISH fed the cat.  The CROW fed the cat.  Example
	text is FISH to make interesting.  The man fed the CROW.  The
	worm fed the FISH.  Example text is hard to make CROW.  END.

>>> Go through the example above deleting all occurences of "TOAD":
>>>     Move to the beginning of the EXAMPLE paragraph above.
>>>     Type  /TOAD  and press RETURN (recall tutorial #2)
>>>	Delete the word by typing  dw
>>>     Type  n  to move to the next occurence of "TOAD"
>>>     Type  .  (dot) to repeat the  dw  command
>>>     Use  n.  to delete the remaining "TOAD"s

Note that  .  only repeats changes, not cursor movements.


WINDOW ACTIONS
--------------
You are already familiar with the  ^U  (depress the control key and
type u) and ^D  commands from tutorial #1.

	^D	Move DOWN one half-screen
	^U	Move UP one half-screen

There are several related commands:

	^F	Move FORWARD one full-screen
	^B	Move BACKWARD one full-screen

SUSPENDING VI
-------------
Here is a way to go back and forth between vi and the Unix command
line:

	^Z	Suspend this job and return to the Unix command line
	fg	(foreground) Continue the suspended job

With this pair of commands you can SUSPEND the vi session, do something
from the Unix command line, then resume the suspended session by
typing  fg  at the command line.  Note that  fg  stands for foreground.

Read these instructions CAREFULLY before suspending vi.
>>>     (Imagine you have an urge to type  ls  at the command line).
>>>     Type  ^Z  to suspend vi.
>>>     At the command line type  ls  and then  fg  to foreground vi.

If your shell does not support job control, e.g. /bin/sh, then the ^Z
command will beep instead of suspending vi.


SUMMARY
-------

	.	(dot) repeat last change

	^D      Move DOWN one half-screen
		(depress the control key and type d)

	^U      Move UP one half-screen
		(depress the control key and type u)

	^F	Move FORWARD one full-screen

	^B	Move BACKWARD one full-screen

	^Z	Suspend this job and return to the Unix command line

	fg	(foreground) Continue the suspended job

These commands should significantly speed up your editing. Have a nice
day.
