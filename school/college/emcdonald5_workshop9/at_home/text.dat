Compound types are types that a programmer constructs from a language's
fundamental types and/or other compound types.  In C++11, compound types
include pointers and references to existing types, enumerations of named
constant values, arrays of objects of an existing type, classes and function
types.  C++11 clarified the difference between lvalues and rvalues and
references to each, which helped simplify many of the facilities available
in the standard library.

This chapter describes the non-function types in detail.  The description
includes a review of one-dimensional arrays in both static and dynamic memory
and shows how to allocate multi-dimensional arrays in both static and dynamic
memory.  The description of classes reviews class definitions, introduces
move-constructors and move-assignment operators and includes declarations of
special members such as bit fields, class variables and class functions.
